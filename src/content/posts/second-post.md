# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows you to build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript. It's perfect for content-focused websites like blogs, documentation, and portfolios.

## Why Astro?

- **Performance**: Astro sends zero JavaScript to the client by default
- **Component Islands**: Use your favorite UI components (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- **Easy Content Management**: Built-in support for Markdown and MDX
- **Fast Development**: Hot module reloading and quick build times

## Basic Setup

```bash
# Create a new Astro project
npm create astro@latest

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Astro makes it incredibly easy to build fast, content-focused websites without sacrificing developer experience.
